1. Create a table that displays a list of books with fields such as title, author, genre, release year, and rating. Ensure the table is paginated and shows only 5 items per page.

2. Add an input field for filtering items while typing, with a 1-second debounce delay.

3. Provide a dropdown menu for sorting by different fields or resetting to the original order (no sorting).

4. Use a fixed list of 30 book items as the dataset.
